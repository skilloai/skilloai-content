# Skills Directory

**Welcome to the skills folder!** This is where all 179+ specialized AI skills live.

## 🤔 What Are Skills?

Skills are specialized instruction sets that teach AI assistants how to handle specific tasks. Think of them as expert knowledge modules that your AI can load on-demand.

**Simple analogy:** Just like you might consult different experts (a designer, a security expert, a marketer), skills let your AI become an expert in different areas when you need them.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each skill lives in its own folder with this structure:

```
skills/
├── skill-name/              # Individual skill folder
│   ├── SKILL.md             # Main skill definition (required)
│   ├── scripts/             # Helper scripts (optional)
│   ├── examples/            # Usage examples (optional)
│   └── resources/           # Templates & resources (optional)
```

**Key point:** Only `SKILL.md` is required. Everything else is optional!

## How to Use Skills

### Step 1: Make sure skills are installed
Skills should be in your `.agent/skills/` directory (or `.claude/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, etc.)

### Step 2: Invoke a skill in your AI chat
Use the `@` symbol followed by the skill name:

```
@brainstorming help me design a todo app
```

or

```
@stripe-integration add payment processing to my app
```

### Step 3: The AI becomes an expert
The AI loads that skill's knowledge and helps you with specialized expertise!

## 🚀 Running MCP Servers

SkilloAI content can be extended with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers to give your AI real-time tools and data access.

### 1. Standalone Execution
Most MCP servers in this ecosystem can be run directly using `npx` (for Node.js) or `uv` (for Python):

```bash
# Node.js MCP Server
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything

# Python MCP Server
uvx mcp-server-sqlite
```

### 2. CLI Integration
You can use the SkilloAI CLI to manage and interact with these servers:

```bash
skilloai run "use the sqlite mcp to list tables"
```

### 3. IDE Integration (Claude Desktop/Cursor)
To use MCP servers in your favorite IDE, add them to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@username/my-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```
